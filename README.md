# Duality Properties of Renyi Entropy

These files contain the results presented in figures 1-6 of paper "Application of duality properties of Renyi  entropy  for parameter tuning in  an unsupervised machine learning task".

In each file:

* column J contains Renyi entropy values calculated in q-form in dependence of the number of topics;
* column P contains Renyi entropy values calculated in (2-q)-form in dependence of the number of topics;
* column U contains Renyi entropy values calculated in (1/q)-form in dependence of the number of topics.
